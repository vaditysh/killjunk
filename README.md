# killjunk
Kill junk from your pc in one script, also disable useless telemetries

**NOTE**
This might have *possibly* unwanted changes. These include:

# Disabling Xbox prcoesses
The program disables Xbox telemetries (this wont affect you if you dont use Xbox whilst executing the program)
# Disabling Remote registries
Wont really affect you unless you are in a work domain or using a work computer (might sometimes be used by workgroup owner)
# Disabling Windows insiders program
This is a program where you get to experience raw, freshly baked updates. This will be turned off because it eats some resources and is really useless
# Deleting temporary files
This wont affect you too, since temporary files dont affect your system, and may take up a lot of space (rarely)
# Deleting Recycle Bin contents
Wont affect you too unless you wanna recover old files recently deleted.
# Delete thumbnails
These are preview thumbnails for your files. They probably will reload soon, but you just get it debloated within the cleanmgr module at once.
